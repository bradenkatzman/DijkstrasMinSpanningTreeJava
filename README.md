# DijkstrasMinSpanningTreeJava
Java Minimum Spanning Tree using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This is a Java program that I wrote that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to build Minimum Spanning Trees
between US cities. Through a GUI, users can select two cities from a drop down menu, and compute the
MST as well as the total distance traveled.

There are two screenshots in the repository, map.png and MST.png, that show the program running.
